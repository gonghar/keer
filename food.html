          What is the Buddhist diet? In simple terms, it is about having the same diet as the Buddhists, a time-controlled diet that limits the type of food you eat, just like the monks in the temples who are very conscious of the concept of time and enforce the "no food after lunch" as their commandment. Of course, this doesn't mean that you have to eat exactly like a monk in a monastery, but a Buddhist diet can still promote occasional indulgence.

          So what do you need to do to start a 'Buddhist diet'? Nothing really, because there is nothing you don't already have, including a change of faith and mindset. The amazing thing about this diet is that it will gradually control your evening snacking and mindless eating. A typical idea from the 'Buddhist diet' books is to eat what you want, but not junk food. There are no hard and fast rules about what to eat and what not to eat, the most important thing is to eat what you like. Instead of labelling foods as 'good' or 'bad', think about what is good for your body. For example, eat more healthy fats, fibre, vegetables or protein from meat, and less sugar, processed foods or alcoholic beverages.
