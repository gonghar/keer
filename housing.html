          Against the backdrop of high property prices in China, I wonder if you've noticed that young people don't seem to be so keen to talk about houses anymore. If you take a closer look, you will find that there is a "Buddha-ish" atmosphere among young people, with such morose "You don't have nothing, at least, you have your weight" as "Today is hard, tomorrow might be even harder" and "You don't have nothing. "You don't have nothing, at least you have weight". What a house represents, the symbol of the middle class, the security of fertility, the sign of property, all this has lost its meaning for young people who just want to get their income up a bit more, to be a little more generous with their money, to live in peace and quiet, without being disturbed or manipulated. Buying a house and being kidnapped by a high mortgage for the rest of their lives may not really be what they want. This is the Buddhist attitude to buying a house of today's youth.
