With such a competitive and harsh workplace environment, the odds are that young people now have a more pessimistic attitude than their parents and post-80s before them. Their Buddhist attitude to work is to do their job when they have to. When they don't have to work, they get by and lay flat first. No overtime, no leaving early. At the same time, look for every possible opportunity to quit the workplace for good and return to life altogether. Perhaps because they have witnessed or heard of their fathers or others being mercilessly dismissed by their bosses, young people today tend to see society in a colder, harsher and therefore more realistic light than previous generations. As they see it, I work for the company and the company pays me for my work, and that's all there is to it. They have no confidence, no enthusiasm and always adopt a coping attitude when working, doing as little as they can, avoiding work as much as they can, and doing things in a perfunctory manner. They just want to be worthy of the wages they earn.
