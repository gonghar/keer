          Nowadays, for young people, the simple and efficient Buddhist way of travelling is more popular. Young people who work hard in big cities have earned all the time they can save. As the old saying goes, time is life, just like when we sleep in until the afternoon on weekends, and when we wake up not long afterwards it is already dark, we feel that we have done nothing for the day, but the day is just gone. First-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai require a lot of time costs to get to and from work every day, and transport such as subways and buses are essential. Although more people choose these mass transport options, there are disadvantages to them, such as too much traffic, more time consuming and not as comfortable.

          In recent years, car hire travel has gradually become more sought after by young people. Car hire is more convenient than taking a taxi, and at the same time more independent and safer for epidemic situations. Car rental platforms are also more improved as more and more people use them, with more good cars and new cars landing on car rental software, giving consumers more choice. Even if you drive out on a self-drive trip, you don't have to be afraid of having trouble returning the car. The cost of renting a car is lower compared to buying a car, but it has the same effect as buying a car. Driving to work not only saves time but also improves efficiency, and the quality of life will be improved with more time for yourself.
