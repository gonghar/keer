            Today, conspicuous consumption is really common. We always get to know someone’s personality, identity, social status and wealth by seeing what they are wearing. It leads to people are not merely purchasing the products' actual value instead they focus on how the item increases their status，also the taste among their peers.

            However, fashion can be pursued with something or without desire. This is also the Buddhist way of wearing. The design of the clothing changes as the fashion shifts, the Buddhist pursuit is a pointless attitude. Firstly, Buddhist dressing does not mean dressing like a monk, but rather a casual, calm feeling. A pair of good walking shoes, a pair of loose trousers and a simple outfit are enough. Solid colours are less likely to be wrong and harder to pick out. That's why the simple, minimalist designs are more Buddhist. In terms of price, Buddhist dressing does not pursue brand or price in order to show off anything.

            Buddhist dressing is not a maverick, just a different concept, and most of what is advocated is also a simple and light-hearted dressing attitude, which is exactly where Buddhist dressing feels appropriate and is an attitude to life.
